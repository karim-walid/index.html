It is known that the new technological revolution and the new industrial revolution are gaining momentum. We believe that the new era of ‘Internet plus artificial intelligence (AI)’, characterized by ubiquitous networks, data-drivenness, shared services, cross-border integration, automatic intelligence, and mass innovation, is coming. The rapid development and fusion of new AI technologies with Internet technologies, new-generation information technologies, new energy technologies, materials technology, and biotechnology is an essential part of this new era, which in turn will enable the game-changing transformation of models, means, and ecosystems in terms of their application to the national economy, well-being, and national security.The manufacturing industry is a cornerstone of national economy, people’s livelihood, and national security. The deep fusion of manufacturing technology with information communication technology, intelligent technology, and product-related expertise in particular, is enabling a game-changing transformation in terms of manufacturing models, manufacturing approaches, and its ecosystems.With the current popularization of the Internet, the universal existence of sensors, the emergence of big data, development of e-commerce, rise of the information community, and the interconnection and fusion of data and knowledge with society, physical space, and cyberspace, the information environment for AI development has been changed profoundly, leading to a new evolutionary phase: AI 2.0 (Pan, 2016). The emergence of new technologies also enables a new phase of AI. The main features of AI 2.0 include the emergence of data-driven intuitive perception ability for intensive deep learning, Internet-based swarm intelligence, technology-oriented human-machine hybrid augmented intelligence, as well as the rise of cross-media reasoning (Pan, 2016).

The continuous evolution of smart cities, intelligent medical care, intelligent transportation, intelligent logistics, intelligent robots, self-driving vehicles, smart-phones, intelligent toys, smart communities, and smart economies, to name but a few, provides a broad market demand and driving force in terms of new development of both AI technologies and applications.
We believe that intelligent manufacturing is a new manufacturing model and the technical means by which new information and communication technology, intelligent science and technology, large manufacturing technology (including design, production, management, testing, and integration), system engineering technology, and related product technology are integrated with the whole system and lifecycle of product development. The life cycle of manufacturing thus uses autonomous sensing, interconnection, collaboration, learning, analysis, cognition, decision-making, control, and the execution of human, machine, material, and environmental information to enable the integration and optimization of various aspects of a manufacturing enterprise or group, including three elements (people/organizations, operational management, and equipment and technology) and five flows (information flow, logistics flow, capital flow, knowledge flow, and service flow). This facilitates production and provides a high efficiency, high quality, cost-effective, and environment-friendly service for users, and therefore improves the market competitiveness of the manufacturing enterprise or group.AI is applied in the field of intelligent manufacturing through the intelligent manufacturing system. The application of AI beyond the intelligent manufacturing system does not make any sense. Against the background of ‘Internet plus AI’, the intelligent manufacturing system is characterized by autonomous intelligent sensing, interconnection, collaboration, learning, analysis, cognition, decision-making, control, and execution of human, machine, material, environment, and information in the whole system and life cycle. The system consists of a resources/capacities layer, a ubiquitous network layer, a service platform, an intelligent cloud service application layer, as well as a security management and standard specification system.The resources/capacities layer includes manufacturing resources and manufacturing capacities, including: (1) hard manufacturing resources such as machine tools, robots, machining centers, computing equipment, simulation test equipment, materials and energies; (2) soft manufacturing resources such as models, (big) data, software, information, and knowledge in the manufacturing process; (3) manufacturing capacities of demonstration, design, production, simulation, experiment, management, sales, operation, maintenance, and integration in the manufacturing process as well as new digital, networked, and intelligent manufacturing interconnection products.
